Visual search models, utilizing architectures like EfficientNetB0, are increasingly employed for retrieving similar objects based on visual similarity or similarity in the space of object attributes. These models leverage deep learning techniques to revolutionize the way we find and discover items in images. These models start by extracting high-level features from images, transforming them into feature vectors, and placing these vectors in an embedding space. In this space, objects with similar visual content are grouped together, simplifying the retrieval process. Additionally, they incorporate similarity metrics and can consider object attributes, such as color or textual descriptions, to enhance the accuracy of search results.
